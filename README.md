# AI-Webinar Project
**Date:** August, 2024

**Author:** Jordan Graham, Senior Developer with Aten Design Group

Welcome to the AI-Webinar project! This project is a basic Drupal 11 site that includes some GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

## Overview

This project includes several Github Actions workflows designed to automate tasks such as creating QA environments for each pull request and deployment. However, these workflows might require some adjustments, as Aten Design Group has transitioned to using a set of private Github Actions that are not available in this public repository -- so YMMV.

### Aten Design Group Custom Actions

Our agency, Aten Design Group, has implemented a set of private GitHub Actions that are used in this project. These custom actions are tailored to our internal processes and may not be directly applicable to your setup. As such, your mileage may vary (YMMV) when using these workflows.
